Notes:
    forward kinematics of a robot with 4 degrees of freedom.
    *find the end effector

Declare the matrices for the 4 transformational matrices T1...T4
INITIALIZE the link length (a), Twist Angle(alpha), Joint offset(d), Joint angle(theta) for the entries in the transformational matrices T1...T4
Make all the transformational matrices to be identity matrices

insert all the link description and the joint description involved in T1...T4

do the matrix multiplication T1 * T2 * T3 * T4

block the entries between 0,0 to 3,3 to be the end effector orientation
column 4 to be the end effector position
